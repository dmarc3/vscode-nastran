6.1  NASTRAN MESSAGES

   There are three categories of diagnostic messages in NASTRAN. They are:

   1. Rigid format error messages

   2. Structure plotter error messages

   3. NASTRAN system and user diagnostic messages

   The rigid format error messages are fully described in Volume II under the
description of the individual rigid formats. The structure plotter error
messages are described in Section 4.2.3. The NASTRAN system and user
diagnostic messages are detailed in this section.

   The system and user diagnostic messages issued by NASTRAN are identified by
numbers. Message numbers have been assigned in groups as follows:

      1  - 1000   Preface Messages

   1001  - 2000   Executive Module Messages

   2001  -        Functional Module Messages

These messages have the following format:

        É        »  É             »
        º SYSTEM º  º FATAL       º
   ***  º        º  º WARNING     º MESSAGE id, text
        º USER   º  º INFORMATION º
        È        ¼  È             ¼

where "id" is a unique message identification number and "text" is the message
as indicated in capital letters for each of the diagnostic messages. A series
of asterisks in the text indicates information that will be filled in for a
specific use of the message, such as the number of a grid point or the name of
a bulk data card. Many of the messages are followed by additional explanatory
material, including suggestions for remedial action.

   The system and user messages described in this section pertain only to
those messages generated by NASTRAN. Although these messages can appear at
various places in the output stream, they should be easily identified by their
format. The various computer operating systems also produce diagnostic
messages that can appear at various places in the output stream. The format of
these messages will vary with the operating system. Reference should be made
to the operating system manuals for interpretation of the messages that are
not generated by NASTRAN.

   System messages refer to diagnostics that are associated with program
errors. In general, you cannot correct such. Refer to the Programmer's Manual
and assistance secured from the programming staff. User messages refer to
errors that are usually associated with the preparation of the NASTRAN Data
Deck. Corrective action is indicated in the message text or the explanatory
information following the text. In some cases reference may have to be made to
other sections of the User's Manual for proper card formats or for
clarification of procedures.

   Fatal messages cause the termination of the execution following the
printing of the message text. These messages will always appear at the end of
the NASTRAN output. Warning and information messages will appear at various
places in the output stream. Such messages only convey warnings or
information. Consequently, the execution continues in a normal manner
following the printing of the message text.

   As an example, consider message number 2025, which will appear in the
printed output as follows:

   *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 2025, UNDEFINED COORDINATE SYSTEM 102.

The three leading asterisks (***) are always present in the system and user
diagnostic messages. The word USER indicates that this is a user message
rather than a system message. The word FATAL indicates that this is a fatal
message rather than a warning or an information message. The number 2025 is
the identification number for this message. The text of the message follows
the comma (,). The number 102 replaces the asterisks (****) in the general
message text, and indicates that 102 is the identification number of the
undefined coordinate system.

304 ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 304, IFP NOT READING NPTP. FILE BEING READ = ****

        The Input File Processor subroutine IFP attempts to locate the bulk
        data file on the NPTP by searching it forward. The first two words of
        the file header records are examined for a match with the Hollerith
        string BULKDATA. If the bulk data is not found by the fifth file, the
        assumption is made that IFP is either not reading NPTP or that it has
        been badly written. The header record of the fifth file is printed as
        part of the message.

305 ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 305, GINO CANNOT OPEN FILE ******

        Unexpected nonstandard return from OPEN.

306 ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 306, READ LOGIC RECORD ERROR.

601 ***  USER FATAL MESSAGE 601, THE KEYWORD ON THE ABOVE CARD IS ILLEGAL OR
         MISSPELLED. SEE THE FOLLOWING LIST FOR LEGAL KEY WORDS.

        Case Control expects each card to begin with a keyword (usually 4
        characters in length). Your card does not. User Message 612 will list
        the legal keywords along with a brief description of function. To
        remove the error, consult Message 612 of NASTRAN Case Control card
        descriptions, Section 2.3, and spell your request correctly.

         SYMCOM OR SUBCOM CARD.

        SYMSEQ or SUBSEQ cards must appear in a subcase defined by a SYMCOM
        or SUBCOM card. Check your Case Control Deck order and relabel your
        combination subcase.

606 ***  USER FATAL MESSAGE 606, A REQUEST FOR TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT MATERIALS

        Only one temperature field for materials is allowed per NASTRAN run.
        The last specified will be used for the entire run. If additional
        ones are desired, a modified restart is in order.

607 ***  USER FATAL MESSAGE 607, A REPCASE SUBCASE MUST BE PRECEDED BY A SUBCASE
         OR SYM SUBCASE.

        A REPCASE subcase is an attempt to re-output the previously computed
        case; therefore it cannot be the first subcase.

608 ***  USER FATAL MESSAGE 608, THE SET ID SPECIFIED ON THE ABOVE CARD MUST BE
         DEFINED PRIOR TO THIS CARD.

        Set identification numbers must be specified prior to their use.

         IDENTIFYING INTEGER.

        Subcase type cards must have an identifying integer. These numbers
        must be strictly increasing. Renumber your subcase cards. The use of
        a non-blank delimiter (for example, "=") will also cause this message
        to occur.

616 ***  USER FATAL MESSAGE 616, ELEMENT IN THRU RANGE LIES IN RANGE OF PREVIOUS
         THRU OR EXCEPT. MISSING ELEMENT OR INCORRECT USE OF THRU.

        EXCEPT in SET list can only be followed by integers.  An integer
        larger than THRU pair terminates THRU. Either list exceptions
        explicitly, use two THRUs, or terminate first THRU.

617 ***  USER FATAL MESSAGE 617, INCORRECT OR MISSING VALUE ON CASE CONTROL
         CARD. CHECK FOR CORRECT CARD FORMAT.

        Most integer values in Case Control must be positive. The above card
        either has a negative integer or a BCD value in place of a positive
        integer. Check the Case Control Deck documentation in Section 2.3 for
        the proper card format.

1139  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 1139, ON AN INITIAL CALL TO GETSTR, THE RECORD
           IS NOT POSITIONED AT THE COLUMN HEADER.

          Either the record is not a string formatted record, or the calling
          routine has not made a proper sequence of GETSTR, ENDGET calls.

1140  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 1140, STRING DEFINITION WORD NOT RECOGNIZABLE.

          Probable cause is a failure to call ENDGET to complete processing
          of the previous string.

1141  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 1141, FIRST WORD OF A DOUBLE PRECISION STRING IS
           NOT ON A DOUBLE PRECISION BOUNDARY.

           NOT WRITTEN WITH STRING TRAILERS.

1147  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 1147, STRING RECOGNITION WORD NOT RECOGNIZED.

          A subroutine may not have called GETSTR to indicate completion of
          processing of previous string or a bug in GETSTR logic.

1148  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 1148, RECORD CONTROL WORD NOT IN EXPECTED
           POSITION.

          Logic error in GETSTR or PUTSTR when string was written.

          possible I/O error.

1163  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 1163, A READ ATTEMPT WHEN THE CORRESPONDING
           SUBINDEX IS ZERO.

          Normally this indicates an attempt to read past the
          end-of-information. However, if called from FILPOS, suspect is
          subroutine error in saving and returning a correct file position.

1164  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 1164, FOLLOWING A READ ATTEMPT ON AN INDEXED

          undefined. Possible causes include, but are not limited to, (1) the
          length of a rod or bar is zero because the end points have the same
          coordinates, (2) the sides of a triangle or quadrilateral are
          collinear which leads to a zero cross product in defining an

          previous COMBINE or REDUCE must be DESTROYed before it may be used
          again. An alternative is to EQUIV the substructure in question to a
          new substructure and then use the new substructure in the desired
          COMBINE operation. See message 6105.
