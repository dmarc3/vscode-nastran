In dynamic analysis (SOLs 103, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 145, 146, and 200), METHCMRS specifies the set identification number of an EIGR or EIGRL entry to be used in the calculation of the normal modes on the v-set of the residual structure.

By default, the residual structure v-set normal modes will be computed based on the METHOD Case Control command selection as long as q-set is present.
