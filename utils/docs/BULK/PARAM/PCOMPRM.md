Default = 0

PCOMPRM controls the computation and printout of composite element extreme ply stresses, strains, failure Indices and strength ratios. Note that extreme ply output encompasses ply stresses, ply strains, ply failure indices and ply strength ratios together. Punch output is not available for extreme ply results.

     PCOMPRM = 0 (default) , STANDARD composite ply responses are output.

     PCOMPRM = 1 STANDARD & EXTREME composite ply responses are output

     PCOMPRM = 2 ONLY EXTREME composite ply responses are output
