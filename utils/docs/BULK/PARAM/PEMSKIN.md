## [PEMSKIN](https://nexus.hexagon.com/documentationcenter/bundle/MSC_Nastran_2022.4/page/Nastran_Combined_Book/qrg/parameters/TOC.PEMSKIN.xhtml)

‘PARAM,PEMSKIN,1’ is used for Actran to couple the trim bodies only to the surface of the cavity and will not search any node inside the cavities. The default value for PEMSKIN is 0 which allows Actran to target both surface and interior nodes of the cavities for trim bodies coupling.
