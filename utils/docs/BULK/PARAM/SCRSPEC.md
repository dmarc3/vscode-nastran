Default    = -1 (SOLs 103 and 115 only)

SCRSPEC=0 requests that structural response be calculated for response spectra input in normal modes analysis. See  Response Spectrum Analysis  (Ch. 9) in the  MSC Nastran Dynamic Analysis User’s Guide  for a discussion of this capability. The scaled response calculations are made for elements and grid points of the residual structure only. There exist two basic methods which are controlled by PARAM,CQC. The default (CQC=0) selects the traditional method. CQC > 0 selects a more recent method called the complete quadratic method of peak response combination—also called the CQC method. In both methods, the responses are summed with the ABS, SRSS, NRL, or NRLO convention, depending on the value of PARAM,OPTION. If the SRSS, NRL, or NRLO options are used, close natural frequencies will be summed by the ABS convention, where close natural frequencies meet the inequality  ![parameters01793.jpg](https://help-be.hexagonmi.com/bundle/MSC_Nastran_2022.4/page/Nastran_Combined_Book/qrg/parameters/../../../assets/parameters01793.jpg?_LANG=enus) .  Both PARAM,OPTION and PARAM,CLOSE may be set in any subcase, allowing summation by several conventions in a single run.

In Version 70, the NRL option has been modified slightly to correspond to the NAVSEA-0908-LP-000-3010 specification. NRLO provides the V69 NRL.

PARAM,CQC,1 or 2 selects the complete quadratic method of peak response combination; also called the CQC method. PARAM,CQC,1 selects CQC method of response combination for sum across modes.   PARAM,CQC,2 is same PARAM,CQC,1, but outputs the CQC coefficients for each mode ij pair and frequency and damping for each mode. The default is to consider all modes in the calculation but if only a subset of modes are of interest then a DTI,CQC,1,... Bulk Data entry may be used to specify a list of modes (by mode number) to retain for the CQC solution. When multiple excitation directions are specified, PARAM,CQC,1 or 2 specifies the summation across the modes and PARAM,OPTION specifies the summation across excitation directions.  As with PARAM,OPTION and PARAM,CLOSE, when PARAM,CQC is used at the subcase level, each subcase can have a different value specified for OPTION, CLOSE and CQC.  This allows comparisons to be made in the same run among summation across directions using ABS and SRSS methods while using the CQC method to sum across modes.

For the CQC method, PARAM,DIROUT,YES (Default = NO) outputs the responses combined across the modes for each separate excitation direction as well as the responses combined across modes and directions. This allows results to be assessed per excitation direction and for the total combined response. PARAM,POST,-1 will write the additional directional responses to the op2 file for post processing with Patran. In this case, the directional responses will be labeled in the Patran Results menu with a TIME value corresponding to the excitation sequence number. For example, if the SUPORT entry specifies the following degrees of freedom to be excited: SUPORT,1,123 then direction 1 will be labeled with TIME value 1, direction 2 with TIME value 2, etc. PARAM,POST,-1 will also write the additional maximum response to the op2 file for post processing. In this case, the maximum response will be labeled in the Patran Results menu with a TIME value 4.

For the CQC method, PARAM,NEWMARK,YES (Default = NO) may be used in the case where 3 simultaneous excitation directions are defined and calculate the Newmark combinations across the excitations directions using the 40% rule. PARAM,PERCENT (Default = 40) may be used to specify a different percentage for Newmark combinations.
