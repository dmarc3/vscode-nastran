## [NFDOPTS](https://help.hexagonmi.com/bundle/MSC_Nastran_2022.4/page/Nastran_Combined_Book/qrg/parameters/TOC.NFDOPTS.xhtml)

Default = 2

PARAM, NFDOPTS, 2 computes frequency dependent matrices at master frequencies. Â In general, master frequencies via MFREQ in case control section of input deck is less than the number of forcing frequencies. Hence, PARAM, NFDOPTS, 2 can improve performance as well as reduce disk space requirement for large frequency response jobs. With PARAM, NFDOPTS, 1, frequency dependent matrices are computed at forcing frequencies.
