## [OSWELM](https://nexus.hexagon.com/documentationcenter/bundle/MSC_Nastran_2022.4/page/Nastran_Combined_Book/qrg/parameters/TOC.OSWELM.xhtml)

Default = -1

Offset for identification numbers of internally generated RBE3 rigid body elements (generated by all formats of CFAST and CSEAM as well as CWELD with formats ELEMID, GRIDID, ELPAT and PARTPAT). By default, OSWELM=-1, the numbering starts with SYSTEM(182) + 1. The default of system cell 182 is SYSTEM(182)=100,001,001. If the user defines OSWELM > 0, then the numbering starts with OSWELM + 1.

Active ONLY for "PARAM,OLDWELD,YES",  for each CWELD element, a pair of RWELD constraint elements is generated if MSET=ON is specified, see the entry PWELD, 3329 for an explanation.

Active ONLY for "PARAM,OLDWELD,YES",  in an SOL 400 nonlinear analysis this defines the offset for identification numbers of internally generated RBE3 rigid body elements (generated by CWELD and CFAST, all formats) and CONM2 mass elements (generated by CFAST when it has nonzero mass). The default behavior in SOL 400 is the same as in the linear solution sequences.
