Default    = NO

UPDTBSH controls the update of boundary shapes generated by auxiliary boundary model analysis in SOL 200.  By default, the auxiliary boundary models and shapes are generated only once at the initial design cycle and will not be updated in subsequent cycles even if the shape of the primary model is changing.  PARAM,UPDTBSH,YES requests that the auxiliary models and shapes are updated and reanalyzed at every cycle.
