Default = 0

If NQSET > 0, and the PARAM entry is in Case Control, all part superelements that do not contain QSET entries, or are not referenced by SENQSET entries in the main Bulk Data Section, have NQSET generalized coordinates assigned to them. These QSET variables are functionally equivalent to those generated by SENQSET entries.
