# Nastran Extension for Visual Studio Code

This [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension aims to build [`Nastran`](https://software.nasa.gov/software/LAR-16804-GS) "language" support with features akin to what software developers are accustomed to in their Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) while programming. `Nastran` stands for "**NA**SA **STR**uctural **AN**alysis" and is a finite element analysis software used to predict the behavior of a physical structure. While `Nastran` is not a programming language itself, `Nastran` models share many similarites to a programming language. These models are composed of text files built with a defined structure using keywords to identify model parameters.

 The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a more efficient means of manipulating `Nastran` finite element models at the text file level through elimination of some of the key pain points and provide a more IDE-like experience.


> **Note**
> There are several flavors of `Nastran`. This extension is specifically built for [`NASTRAN-95`](https://github.com/nasa/NASTRAN-95) - the open-source code which all commercially sold versions are based off of. The intention is to eventually support the two main commercial products, [`MSC Nastran`](https://hexagon.com/products/product-groups/computer-aided-engineering-software/msc-nastran) and [`Simcenter Nastran`](https://plm.sw.siemens.com/en-US/simcenter/mechanical-simulation/nastran/). While commercial versions of `Nastran` may have some differences in key words and file structure, there is significant overlap and this extension may still prove useful.


## Features

Currently supported features include:
1. Syntax Highlighting
    - Color delineation between `Nastran` sections
        - Executive Control Deck
        - Substructure Control Deck
        - Case Control Deck
        - Bulk Data Deck
        - Direct Matrix Abstraction Program
    - Long and short format field highlighting
2. Documentation on keyword hover

> **Note**
> Hover documentation is currently pulling from `NASTRAN-95` documentation only. Even with the version set to `MSC Nastran` documentation from `NASTRAN-95` will be displayed on hover.

3. Include file hierarchy tree view for easy navigation of model. Open top level `Nastran` run deck and run command to parse include paths and generate tree view. Command tied to "refresh" button on view.

4. Command to switch between `NASTRAN-95` and `MSC Nastran` syntax highlighting keywords. `Simcenter Nastran` syntax highlighting not yet developed.

5. "Find All" command (keybound to `ALT`+`F`) to search model for all occurences and provide hyperlink to location in model.

In addition to these features, the following are proposed features with no feasibility assessment or time table for implementation:
- Command to explictly set the `Nastran` section for highlighting. Models are sometimes compartmentalized into "include" files. Current logic searches the file for section breaks (i.e. `CEND`, `BEGIN BULK`, etc.) and colors accordingly. The user may want to be able to open a file which contains exclusively DMAP or Case Control cards.
- Expansion of documentation hovers to support `MSC Nastran` and `Simcenter Nastran` Quick Reference Guide documentation with hyperlinks.
- Interactive plot view of 3D model highlighting currently selected element / grid  / etc.
- Command to build `.vscode/tasks.json` file for executing `Nastran`

If you have an idea for a feature, please create and issue and flag it as a `Feature Request`.

## Requirements
In order to use this extension, the user must have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
    - [`pygls`](https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls)

## Usage
Once the requirements are satisfied and the extension is installed through [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mbakke.vscode-nastran), the extension will automatically activate upon opening a `Nastran` file with the following extensions:
- `*.bdf`
- `*.dat`
- `*.nas`
- `*.inp`

If opening a `Nastran` file with a different extension, users may set the language by pressing `CTRL` + `K` followed by `M` and selecting `Nastran`.

The language will default to version `NASTRAN-95` but will remember the last active version set.

## Known Issues

Please create an issue as bugs are discovered. Provide specific details including screen shots or specific `Nastran` cards causing the bug.

- VS Code does not support hover pane resizing. Depending on the resolution of the monitor, text may be wrapped to a new line and not be presented correctly. Users may find it helpful to reduce font size (`CTRL` + `-`) till hover text is no longer being wrapped.
- Extension was developed using VS Code's `Dark (Visual Studio)` theme. The keyword sections where given colors based off of commonly defined [scopes](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide). All colors should update for the themes packaged with VS Code but the chosen color may not be ideal or be distinguishable relative to adjacent colors.
